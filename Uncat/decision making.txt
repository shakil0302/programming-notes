Intro
===========
Peoples are unable to accept randomness. We give meaning to every shapes.
We underestimate the share of randomness in about everything. In many cases luck
is preceived as non-luck(skill). Probability theory is the science of randomness.

It does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear.
What is given by godness fortuna, can be taken away by her.

People higher in rank in the social pecking order forces us to make the worst mistake,
they rises the unwillingness to accept the randomness. But we need to understand the
luck involved.

Lucky idiots do not look like lucky idiots and they do not know that they belong to
such category. They will act as if they deserved the success. An increase in personal
performance (regardless of whether it is caused deterministically or by the agency
of lady Fortuna) induces a rise of serotonin in  the  subject,
itself  causing  an  increase  of  what  is  commonly  called  leadership  ability.

Accounting
==============
One cannot judge a performance in any given field by the results, but by the costs
of the alternatives. There is always a generator(RNG) which controls what actually
happend. Without understanding the generator, we can't analyze the merit of a
decision.

The problem is, In most generator the event that causes disaster is a rare event.
Thus it is not visible to the naked eye. Which is called the black swan problem.
Even though history warns us about what happend to our seniors, we deny them as that
won't occur to us. Which is known as denigration of history. We see the wealth being
generated, never the processor, a matter that makes people lose sight of their risks. 

But the so called businesswise people are the greatest fool of randomness. And most
of the time they will be your boss. That is something to beware about mature
financial instituitions. They will face the rare event someday too. The remedy to
either play politics with these people or not ot argue with them.

Monte Carlo
===============
We need to learn from history. Because history repeats itself. For past history,
we can read various complex situation in the past and find alternative outcome from
there. To make history we can use Monte Carlo engine which can be used to analyze
any stochastic process. It is possible to verify most ideas with a good monte
carlo engine.

To avoid emotional attachment we should evaluate performance less frequently.
Because of randomness, we see more ups and downs there and its hard to differentiate
between noise and signal. It is better to see summarized view on data rather than
watching each record on live.

Financial Statistics
======================
When using statistics, one should be careful because, we still may not care about
the rare event. Statistician often eliminate extreme cases(outlier) when calculating
mean which only should be done when they do not cause problem. But If a company loses
all its capital, its over.

We see the only the successful people. This is known as survivorship bias. This is why
most of the data we can find is flawed.

Always look for bias in the data! There maybe hidden biases. And a biased data
cant be trusted for any reason.
