Given an array of N integers, find the subarray which sum is maximum.

If all the numbers were positive then the answer would be the whole array.
But existance of negative numbers make it interesting.

1. let a[] is such an array.
2. sum = 0, mx = 0;
3. for each element as a[i]
4. 	sum += a[i]
5.	if(sum < 0) sum = 0
6.	mx = max(mx, sum)

This finds the answer correctly. The only hard to understand statement is 5th one.
I leave it as an exercise to the reader.
