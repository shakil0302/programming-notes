Bitmask DP is also known as DP over subsets. Sometimes we need to calculate in
which order we need to choose some values to get the best result. The cost of
choosing an item depends on the choice of the previous items. For this  reason
we can find the optimal order by trying out all the possibility.

Read subset search from search category.

Now you know all the basics. So bitmask DP is not something very hard.
Initially we set data[0] = solution for empty set, then from 1 to 2^n-1,
we calculate the cost by improving the result from 1 element less sets.

Finally in 2^n-1 all the items will exist, which will contain the solution.
