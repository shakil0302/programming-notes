Suffix Array
Suffix array is a data structure for string. In this structure we
build an array of integer sa[] which holds the starting position of all
the suffixes of a particular string in lexicographically sorted order.
It has a very remarkable property. if i < j < k, then, sa[i] and sa[j] will have
at least equal match as sa[i] and sa[k] if not better match. Also it hold for
sa[j] and sa[k]. Why it works? Remeber, it is lexicographically sorted.

str = "ababa"
sa = [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]

Longest Common Prefix
It is an procedure which takes two integer, i and j, which denotes the
starting position of two suffixes. This computes the length of the longest matched
string started from the first character.

lcp(0, 2) = 3
as 0 = ababa and 2 = aba and the longest match is aba
lcp(0, 1) = 0 as the first character differs.

Using these two tools, we can solved various string problem which we will discuss
shortly.
