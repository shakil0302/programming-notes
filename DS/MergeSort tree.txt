This is a version of segment tree where each node contains a vector of elements
which are fallen in the range in sorted order.

This allow us to query in range with some additional requirement about the ordering
relation of the values.

1. How many elements are there in range [L, R] which is less then K
2. Calculate sum of the elements which fall in the range [L, R] where K <= a[i] <= Z
3. and many more...

The idea is to build the tree as we do in merge sort. and using binary search to find
the answers.
