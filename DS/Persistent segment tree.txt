Given an array a[] of integers and some updates [L, R, v] and queries [L, R, t]
we need to print f([L, R]) after t'th update for each queries.

What can we do it build a persistent segment tree, which stores all the version
of itself.

The idea:
1. A tree is described by its root only. The other nodes are just connected with it.
2. Every update changes only O(log n) nodes at most, including the root.

So the idea is, whenever an update occurs, we store all the nodes that are updated.
As the root will be always updated, the new tree will be linking the new updated node,
and the other nodes that were not updated. So, essentially we have a new tree, but
the existing nodes are reused and is unharmed.

We can no longer use the implicit parent-child indexing. Left and Right child
information will be stored.

And we will allocate memory from a static array. Which will be at most q*log n times
longer than required by usual segment tree.
