Given an array 'arr' of size 'N', you have to perform Q query.
There can be updates, or calculating values for some functions.
The queries may be given in range [L, R].

This can be solve if for all calculation query, [L, R], the answer can
be calculating very easily if we know the answer for,
[L, R1], [L2, R2], ..., [Lk, Rk], [Lk+1, R].

First let, BS = sqrt(N);
Then we separate the [1, n] segment into TB blocks of size BS(except
the last block). This way total number of blocks will be at most sqrt(N) too.

Then we can answer all the queries in O(Q sqrt N) times.
