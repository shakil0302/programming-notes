The trie is a prefix tree. We can store some wards and answer their diffent
properties that depend on prefix and search words with some constraints applied.

node {
	int next[26];
}

Each node represent a char and links the next character in for a word. In this example,
we are taking 26 lowercase character for example.

Now, initially there are only the root node which does represent a dummy start
character. Say, we want to store the word 'tree' there. What should we do?
we go to root, and see if the character t is already exists. If now, we add it.
Then we add 'ree' to that node.

1. Can you search a word?
2. Can you list all the words which has at most 1 dissimilarity?
3. Can you list all the words which has the given prefix?

Like I said, all the question regrading prefix can be answer by trie very easily.
