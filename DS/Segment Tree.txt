Given an array a[] of n numbers and q queries [L, R], we have to calculate some
function f(a[L...R]).

For most functions f, it can be done using segment tree more or less. It is one of
the most popular interval trees.

The idea is to build an tree which will contain information of several intervals
[L, R]. The interval are chosen such a way that the query and update takes no more
than O(log n) time.

build(int nd, int s, int e){
	if(s == e) tree[nd] = a[s];
	int mid = (s+e)/2;
	build(2*nd, s, mid);
	build(2*nd+1, mid+1, e);
	tree[nd] = tree[2*nd]+tree[2*nd+1];
}

Queries and updates are done in similar fashion.
