Treap is a BBST that has a wide range of applocations.

A minimal cartesian tree node holds
1. A value
2. A priority
3. A left and a right pointer

It has two basic functionality to aid others,
1. split(T, x): divies the treap T into L and R where max(L) <= x and min(R) > x
2. merge(L, R): it takes two treaps where max(L) < min(R) and combines them into one.

With these two, other operations can be defined easily. Other needed operations can be,
1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Kth value
4. Cumulative Count

A cartesian tree is called treap if the priority is assigned at random. This helps
the tree to be has the height O(log n) approximately.
