The stl comes in two primary part:
1. Containers
2. Algorithms

There are a few must knowing containers like vector, set, map, deque, queue,
stack, priority_queue.

Among the algorithm, learn sort.

These are enough to solve many begineer level problems. For advanced problem, stl
doesnt take you to far. Learn advanced DS as you encounteer.
