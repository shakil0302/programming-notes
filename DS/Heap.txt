Heap is a balanced binary tree. It can be used as priority queue.
There are two kind of heaps.

1. Max heap
2. Min heap

Here we will consider only max heap.
1. The tree is complete.
2. Parents value i greater than its childs.

Now, given an array a[] of integers, how can we build an heap?
1. Lets use implicit array indexes as tree edge.
a) node at i has a left child at 2*i and right child at 2*i+1
b) root is at 1
Fill the tree with arbitrary numbers from array a[].

Now, lets say we have a function max_heapify which takes an almost
heap tree, and make it heap. By almost means, only the root is not in correct place.
The other nodes follow the max heap property.

Now, we can call this function from the lowest level of the tree to the roots. For all
node which have at least one child(i.e except the leaf level).

This will build the tree as max heap.

Now insert and pop_top can be implemented easily, using this max_heapify function.
