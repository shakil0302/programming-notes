Let f(x) be an unimodal function, then, ternary search can find the x for
which f(x) is minimized or maximized.

The graph of a unimodal function looks like,
f(x) = <<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
where < denotes the value is increasing and > denotes a decrease. Thus <> is the
peak point.

Let,
lo = lowest_possible_value_of_x
hi = highest_possible_value_of_x

Then, let, lets take two point between lo and hi at eq-distance
mid1 = lo+(hi-lo)/3;
mid2 = hi-(hi-lo)/3;

now, if(f(mid1) < f(mid2))
		lo = mid1 //the lo-mid1 portion doesn't contain the answer.
	 else
		hi = mid2 //the mid2-hi portion doesn't contain the answer.
		
We can repeat the procedure for a few times(like 500 to 1000) to get a very
close value of x where f(x) is a peak.
