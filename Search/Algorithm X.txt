Algorithm X is used to solve the exact cover problem.
It is an NP-complete, still using Algorithm X we can solve
it very efficiently.

Exact cover problem
Let there is a set X and another set Y which is a subset of
power(X). Now an exact cover of X is a subset Z of Y, such that,
The union of all sets that belong to Z is X. and all subset of Z
is pairwise disjoint.
