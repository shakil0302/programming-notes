Let there is a set S with N elements. Now lets think we have k properties c1, c2, ...
ck. To count elements in S which doesn't follow any of the property we can do the following,

1. Let C = {c1, c2, ..., c2}
2. For all subset of C as SC,
3. 	If SC contain even number of elements
4.		add the number of elemets which follow SC properties.
5.	otherwise, subtract the number of elemets which follow SC properties.
