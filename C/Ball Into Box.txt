Let,
m = number of balls
n = number of boxes
S(m, n) denotes stirling numbers of second kind.

1. Balls are distinct: TRUE, Boxes are distinct: TRUE, Container Can be Empty: TRUE
	Solution: n^m

2. Balls are distinct: TRUE, Boxes are distinct: TRUE, Container Can be Empty: FALSE
	Solution: n!S(m, n)

3. Balls are distinct: TRUE, Boxes are distinct: FALSE, Container Can be Empty: TRUE
	Solution: for i = 1 to n, SUM: S(m, i)

4. Balls are distinct: TRUE, Boxes are distinct: FALSE, Container Can be Empty: FALSE
	Solution: S(m, n)

5. Balls are distinct: FALSE, Boxes are distinct: TRUE, Container Can be Empty: TRUE
	Solution: C(n+m-1, m)

6. Balls are distinct: FALSE, Boxes are distinct: TRUE, Container Can be Empty: TRUE
	Solution: C(n+m-1, m)

7. Balls are distinct: FALSE, Boxes are distinct: TRUE, Container Can be Empty: FALSE
	Solution: C(m-1, n-1)
