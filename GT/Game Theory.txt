Rules:
1. Each game is played between Left and Right.
2. Each state is defined with a position and a turn.
3. Each position is represented using P = {pL | pR} where pL is
the available options for Left and pR is for right in this position.
4. Each game will terminate.
5. Each game has a starting position.
6. Normally, Who fails to move loses.

Examples:
0 = {} is the simplest game known as Endgame.
1 = {0 | }
-1 = { | 0}
* = {0 | 0} also known as fuzzy.

Winner:
Case 1. G > 0: Left wins.
Case 2. G < 0: Right wins.
Case 3. G = 0: Second player wins.
Case 4. G || 0, First player wins.

Negative of a Game:
-G = {-gR | -gL}

Sum of Games:
When games G and H are played simultanously,
their outcome is their disjunctive sum G + H.

Game Controted Fraction
1. A typical postion has several numbers in boxes.
2. Each turn player can alter one of these number.
3. The denominator of the new number must be strictly less.
4. If the number is an integer, the new number must have less absolute value.
5. Irrational number have infinite denominator.
6. Left can decrease the number and right can increase the number.

Example:
[2/5] = {[1/3] | [1/2]}
This game has the value 3/8 as it is the simplest number between 1/3 and 1/2.

General Solution
Let x = [a; b c d... n+1], then
[x] = a.0^(b-1)1^c0^d... where the fractional part is binary string.

HackenBush Restrained
1. Played on pictures containing black and white edges.
2. Each node must be connected to the ground, otherwise the are removed.
3. Two nodes may be connected with edges. Loops are allowed.
4. Left can chop black edges and Right can chop white edges.

COL and SNORT
1. Both are map coloring game.
2. Left paint with black and Right with white.
3. Two adjacent country can't have same color on COL and
different color on snort.

The game can be analyzed with Duel graph of the map.

NUMBER and GAMES
Solution strategy
1. Analyze simple position 0, 1/2, 1, *, etc
2. Find pattern and general theorem.
3. This way a complete theory can be discovered.

Short Game
Short game is one which has only finitely many positions in all.

Value of a game
WHOM_TO_TURN(GAME_ID) is a way to represent a game value along with turn.

L(G) = MAX R(gL) = L and
R(G) = MIN L(gR) = R
If L < R then it is a number. Otherwise, The game is less then
all value greater than L and greater than all value less then R.
and confused between L and R.

Example
{5 | 4, 7}
So, L(G) = R(5) and R(G) = L(4)
So, G <= 5, G >= 4 and confused between 4 and 5.

All small game
A game is all small if all of its stopping position is zero. ex, {0 | {0 | -2}}

Impartial Game
The game G is impartial if and only if for every position P = {L | R}, we have L = R
From now impartial game will be written as P = {L} and R is assumed.

Nim Game
1. Played with heaps of matchsticks.
2. The legal move is to decrease any number of matchsticks in a heap.
Clearly Nim is a impartial game.

If we write position P = *n for a heap size of n, then
*n = {*m} where m < n.

Bogus Nim
If we allow increasing the matchstick, then the outcome doesn't changes.
As, we can just decrease that amount if we were in winning position.

Grundy Theorem
Each short impartial game is equavalent to play some NIM heap.
If G = {A, B, C,...}, and A, B, C is equavalent to play of heap sized a, b, c,...,
then, G is equavalent to heap with size of smallest non-negative number that is
not present in a, b, c, ... also known as mex of this array.

Example
Let G = {A, B, C} and where A is equavalent to 2, B to 0 and C to 3,
then G is equavalent to 1 as this is the smallest non-negative number not in there.

OCTAL GAME class:
A octal game is represented with A1,A2,... where Ak < 8
Rules:
1. Played with several heaps of stones.
For each Ak, we have some constraints.
a) We can remove k stones form the pile. if,
b) The pile is divided into i pices where the ith bit is 1 of Ak

Example:
333......
We got infinite number of threes. So, We can remove any number of stones.
3 = 2^0+2^1, So, we can take stones such that the pile no longer exist (2^0 case),
or the pile exist(2^1).

77
We got two 7's. So, we can take only one stone or two.
7 = 2^0+2^1+2^2, We can remove these stone such that the pile is divided
into 0, 1 or two pices after the removal.

165
Case 1: The first number is 1 = 2^0
So, we can remove 1 stone, if there is only one stone in that pile. Because,
we need to make it empty(2^0)

Case 2: The second number is 6 = 2^1+2^2
So, we can remove 2 stone if there are more than two stone, because we are not
allowed to make it empty(no 2^0). We can however take two stone in such a that
the pile is broken in two pices or, leave as one pile.

Case 3: The third number is 5 = 2^0+2^2
Well, Take three piece from middle. No three move if 4 stones are left.

Misere Rule
The last player able to move is loser.

Misere NIM:
If we are leaving at least one 2 or bigger sized pile, play normal nim. Otherwise,
leave odd number of one's.

Misere Grundy value:
Unless G is an endgame, find mex. Otherwise the grundy value is 1(in normal case
it would be zero).
