In game theory we will mainly focus on algorithm games. This means, the winning or
losing is predetermined on optimal play for both player, for a given situation. The
game is played into two teams. Both play in the same field(what does it mean?).

How to find if a position is winning or losing?
1. The game condition must have specification on how the game ends. That defines a
losing state.
2. A position is winning, if there is a move which leads to a losing position.
Thus we send our opponent there.
3. A position is losing if for all moves, we reach a winning position. Thus, no matter
what we do, he will go to a winning position.

Now, we can calculate if a position is winning or losing for any game. Sometimes we
find a pattern that helps us to calculate the win lose easily, sometimes we need to
enumerate all states to find the solution. And the sometimes the game will be standard
enough that we know the solution already(?).

Lets analyze a typical situation.
You are given n stones. You can either take 1, 3 or 4 stones. You can opponent make turn
one by one. Then who will win the game if both play optimally?
