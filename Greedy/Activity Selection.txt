Given n activies, each has a starting time Si and an ending time Ei. Find a subset
of tasks which doesn't overlap with each other, and the chosen set is largest.

The first thing we can think of about a greedy problem is to find a heuristic that
may work.

Lets analyze a few of them.
1. Select the one which takes least amount of time.
2. Selects the one which make least clashes with the remaining.
3. Select the one which ends early.

Only the third one works. It is instructive to find it out, why the other two doesn't
work.
