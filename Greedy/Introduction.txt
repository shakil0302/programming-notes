The greedy is a very powerful technique to find a optimal solution to a problem.
It is heuristic based approach. To solve a problem we first make a guess about greedy
choice and try to prove it works. If it doesn't work, then some other may do. And there
may not even a greedy solution exist. But when it does, It is usually the fastest solution
that can solve the problem.

Now, Often, finding the greedy solution is easier if the data is sorted in a certain
property. So, we should always keep an eye on it.
