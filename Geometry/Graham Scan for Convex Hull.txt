The algorithm finds the hull in O(n log n).1. Choose the bottomest-leftmost value and mark it as pivot.2. Sort the remaining points in counter clockwise manner(using the pivot point).3. Take the first three points as point on hull.4. REPEAT5. While the last 3 candidate point make a right turn, delete the middle point.6. Add the next point to candidate list.If we need to choose most or least amount of points, we need to take care aboutstep 5 where co-linear points are to be (dis)allowed.Problem: http://www.spoj.com/problems/BSHEEP/Solution: http://www.spoj.com/files/src/20550283/
