Given a line segment AB and a point P, find whether the point P lies on
left, right or inline with AB.

1. Take A as reference point.
2. Take Br and Pr as the point B and P with respect to reference
3. If Br X Pr < 0 then it lies left
4. If Br X Pr > 0 then it lies right
5. Otherwise it is inline.
