========================================
Convex Hull of a set of points can be found in different ways. The brute
force ways takes O(n^2) times and no additional memory.

Finding the hull
1. Take the leftmost point(in case of tie, take topmost for tiebreak)
2. This point will surely be in the hull.
3. Now, take any other usused points as candidate c.
4. For each unused point p,
5.		if last-c-p makes a left turn
6. 			set c = p
7. Now, this is the next point in the hull.
8. This should be run till we back at start.

NB: If we need to take least/most amount of points on hull,
we need to take care on step 5.
