Centroid decomposition of a tree is a data structure that can be used to store path
information and effectivly answer different tree queries.

Centroid:
A centroid of a tree is a node, removal of which results in a forest of trees where
no resulting tree will contain n/2 nodes where n is the nodes in the original tree.

Centroid Decomposition:
Its a process to build a tree in another tree known as centriod tree.
A centorid tree has a root which is centroid of the original tree. Then we remove the
centroid from the tree which breaks the tree into forest of trees. Then we build the
centroid tree of these subtrees and make them subtrees of the centroid.

Algorithm:
1. Pick a node v as root
2. Calculate subtree size for each node rooted at v
3. Find centroid of the tree using the subtree size information
4. 	if v pass in centorid test take v as centorid
5.	otherwise find the largest subtree of v as v, then, goto 4
6. Mark v as centroid of the tree and for all subtree of v
7.	goto 1 untill no subtree left.
8.	for all subtree of the v, make v as parent of their centroid tree.

Properties of centroid tree:
1. It contains all nodes of the original tree.
2. The height of a centorid tree is at most log n
3. Any path A -> B in the original tree can be break into A -> C + C -> B,
	where C is the LCA(A, B) in the centroid tree. A node in a centroid tree store
	information for path between the node and its ancestor. They are O(n log n).
	Using this we answer any path query in the original tree.
