BFS is a graph search technique which visits the graph layer by layer.

Algorithm:
1. Set visited[] to false
2. Take a unvisited as starting node if any remain, set as visited.
3. push it to a queue q.
4. while q has elements
5.	take z = q.front and pop it out
6.	for all adjacent nodes of z as next
7.		set next as visited
8.		add next to q
9. goto 2
