The MO's algorithm works on continuous range of an array. So, This article
is basically about how to transform an tree into array by leaving certain data
in continous range.

There is two way:
1. DFS order traversal and size count: This will put the nodes of a subtree
together. Helps to make certain subtree queries.

2. DFS visit time decomposition: In this method, we can run a DFS in the tree which
will add two additional information in each nodes. Start time and End time.
This helps us to store path information as that will be in the continous range.
